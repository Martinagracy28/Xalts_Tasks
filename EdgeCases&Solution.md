### Edge Cases and Solutions


1. **Gas Limit Exceeded**
   - **Scenario**: If a function (e.g., `whitelist` or `blacklist`) processes a large number of addresses in one call, it may exceed the gas limit and revert the transaction.
   - **Solution**: Implement batch processing with a fixed maximum number of addresses per transaction (e.g., 10 or 20). Alternatively, use a queue system in the frontend application to process addresses over multiple transactions.

2. **Blacklisted Wallets with Tokens**
   - **Scenario**: If a wallet is blacklisted and attempts to send tokens, the transaction should fail. However, the tokens may still exist in that wallet.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that all transfers from blacklisted wallets are explicitly rejected in the `transfer` function and any internal transfer functions (e.g., `_beforeTokenTransfer`).

3. **State Consistency After Failure**
   - **Scenario**: If an operation partially completes and then fails (e.g., blacklisting several wallets, but one fails), it can leave the contract in an inconsistent state.
   - **Solution**: Use events to log each successful operation, allowing the application to track which addresses were successfully updated. Consider implementing a mechanism to roll back the state if a failure occurs during multi-step operations.

4. **Token Transfer from Uninitialized Addresses**
   - **Scenario**: If a newly created wallet tries to transfer tokens without being whitelisted, the operation should be correctly handled.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that all addresses default to the blacklisted state and validate wallet status in the `transfer` function.

5. **Handling Large Numbers of Addresses & Wallet Interactions Tracking Overhead**
   - **Scenario**:If the network expands to 1000+ wallets, the number of peers for any given wallet could grow significantly. As the number of interactions grows, the `interactedPeers` mapping could become large and costly in terms of gas and storage.
   - **Solution**:  Instead of storing interactions directly in the smart contract, remove the `interactedPeers` mapping from on-chain storage. Instead, emit events each time a wallet interacts with another wallet. The emitted events can include the relevant information about the interaction, such as the wallet addresses involved.

  Here's how this approach works:

  1. **Emit Events**: Modify the transfer and any other relevant functions to emit events detailing the interaction between wallets. For example:

      ```solidity
      event TransferLogged(address indexed from, address indexed to);

      function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
          require(isWhitelisted(msg.sender), "Sender is not whitelisted");
          require(isWhitelisted(recipient), "Recipient is not whitelisted");
          
          // Transfer logic
          _transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
          
          // Emit interaction event
          emit TransferLogged(msg.sender, recipient);
          return true;
      }
      ```

  2. **Off-Chain Data Handling**: Use the Ethers API (or similar web3 libraries) in your frontend application to listen for these events. Store the relevant interaction data in a database when an interaction event is detected.

      - You could set up a listener to capture the emitted events:


  3. **Database Storage**: Create a database schema to efficiently store and manage these interactions, allowing for easy retrieval when needed. This reduces the gas cost and storage overhead associated with tracking interactions directly on-chain.

6. **Event Emission and Indexing**
    - **Scenario**: If the emitted events are not indexed properly, it could lead to issues retrieving relevant data.
    - **Solution**: Ensure that all events have indexed parameters to allow efficient querying from the logs. Use appropriate event design to maximize on-chain and off-chain performance.
